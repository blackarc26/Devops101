					First, you need to be clear that there is no free treatment. It is just that, in the case of a cashless hospitalization, the insurance company will bear the cost of treatment either fully or partially on your behalf.	 <br><br>

					Cashless hospitalization is a facility provided by most health insurance policies and enables an insured customer to obtain admission and undergo the required treatment without a direct payment. The assigned TPA will mediate between the healthcare service provider (Hospital) and the Insurance company and settle the bills on behalf of the insured customer. <br><br>
					However it is important to understand the role of a Hospital in cashless hospitalization. The Hospital is only a facilitator and has no authority to approve or disapprove any request for cashless hospitalization. Certain protocols laid down by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) with respect to cashless hospitalization will need to be adhered to strictly.<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Hospitalization happen fewer than two circumstances â€“ Planned and Emergency. Pre-authorization approval of the estimated hospital expense is a must to avail this facility.
<li>In the case of a planned admission, you would have first consulted a doctor who in turn would have advised you on the probable date of hospitalization. In such a case, you must have applied for an approval of the estimated hospital expenses directly with your TPA at least 4-5 days prior to the date of hospitalization.
<li>In case you have not applied for a pre-authorization sufficiently in advance or if the doctor treating you advises you to get hospitalized immediately after the consultation, our Insurance Cell will assist you through the pre-authorization procedure.
<li>However, you will need to bear in mind that the Insurance Cell is only a facilitator and can in no way influence the decision on the approval. The approval can be turned down.
<li>In case of emergency hospitalization, the Insurance Cell will take up your case on a fast track basis with your TPA and is likely to receive approvals within 3 hours during any working day.
